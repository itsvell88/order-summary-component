(2) Create hover effects for texts & button
(3) Minimising media queries by using clamp in the base style for smoother transition to achieve responsive layout

### Continued development

(1) Setting up a clean and clear hierarchy for containers & components
(2) Keep practicing how to build responsive & fluid layout which across devices
